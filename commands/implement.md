## Your task

- Set the plan in `plan/state.json` example: `{"current": "31-07-feature.md"}`
- Parse the implementation plan to identify all phases/steps
- Create a todo list to track progress through each phase
- For each phase in the plan:
  1. Delegate the specific phase implementation to the `senior-developer` agent

  3. Update the original plan file to mark the phase as completed with [x]
- Update `plan/state.json` with implementation progress: set plan status to "completed"
